 <h2>Top 3 Movies Of all-time</h2><hr>
 <h3>Daniela Forever</h3>
 <p>“Daniela Forever,” Nacho Vigalondo’s first film since his excellent “Colossal,” eight years ago, is a baffling disappointment, a sci-fi mindbender with echoes of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and “Inception,” but no idea what to do with its many ideas or what it’s ultimately trying to say. It devolves into such a shapeless blob that any effort to pick apart its themes feels like fighting with its creator, who may have a firm grip on what he’s trying to say regarding grief, regret, and even agency, but can’t figure out how to convey that to an audience. The result is a deeply frustrating film, a movie that only reminds one how hard it is to do this kind of high-concept sci-fi thing well. This is what happens when an undeniably talented creator lets it get away from them.

Nicolas (Henry Golding) is a DJ who has just lost the love of his life, Daniela (Beatrice Grannò). He joins an experimental program a la “Spotless Mind” that promises him lucid dreams, with the assumption being that if people could control visions of lost loved ones, it would help them better manage their grief. Want one more catch with Dad? One more walk on the beach with your wife? It’s a great idea for a feature, but that’s precisely where Vigalondo gets stuck, refusing to really explore the potential of his high concept in favor of wallowing in the misery of his protagonist.</p>
<h2>Wild Diamond</h2>
<p>When Liane (Malou Khebizi) says she wants to be “the French Kim Kardashian,” it’s easy to see her as delusional, or, at the very least, operating with a skewed value system. The reality of Liane’s life has not set her up for success of the influencer variety or any other kind. She lives in what appears to be a low-income housing project in Fréjus, surrounded by a wasteland of concrete and dried-up canals. Her mother (Andréa Bescond) is in and out of bed with different “sugar daddies,” and her grade school-aged sister Alicia (Ashley Romano) clearly needs looking after. Liane is consumed by a desire to transcend her circumstances and enter a magical realm where she will be “seen.” It’s more obsession than goal. She can barely tolerate life on this plane. Evoking this state of mind is one of the things that “Wild Diamond,” the debut feature from director Agathe Riedinger, does really well.</p>
<h2>Sovereign</h2>
<p>Men like Jerry Kane (Nick Offerman), rural citizens who have twisted common laws to serve their own reality, were once a “silent minority.” But now, with the sharp shift toward the right in online and political rhetoric, they are significantly less quiet. A former roofer from Arkansas, Jerry is a man who spends some of his days traveling across the country to deliver speeches to desperate people, individuals angered by a system they believe is taking advantage of them. Conversely, he occupies his nights by guesting on a radio show where he shares the best ways to defy the law. His political beliefs, however, cannot save him or his reserved teenage son Joe (Jacob Tremblay) from the truth: They are fighting a losing battle. </p>
